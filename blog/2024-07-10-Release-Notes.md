<!-- truncate -->

## What's New

- **Alarm Parameters Update:** The alarm parameters page now displays
  alarm parameters in a filterable and sortable table. Alarm parameters
  are set at the site level and can be site-specific or shared via alarm
  parameter templates. All changes are automatically tracked by the
  platform for auditing purposes. These updates enhance alarm setting
  flexibility, improve visibility and troubleshooting of alarm
  thresholds, and offer detailed change tracking over time. *Your
  existing alarm parameters have automatically been moved over to the
  new format, so no action is required!* **[Check it out
  here]. (Link to user Specific Alarm Parameters Page -**

- **Emission Trends Date Selection:** You can now select the time range
  on the emissions trends page and emission trends widgets. This enables
  improved trending and monitoring of cumulative emission performance at
  both the site and organizational level over time.

## What's Coming?

- **Alarm Workflow & Classification:** Enhance alarm response by
  assigning classifications and identifying root causes within the
  platform.
