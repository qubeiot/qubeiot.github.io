How can the model differentiate between on site emission sources and other nearby methane producing sources?

A well planned deployment will always include "upwind" devices which can be used to differentiate between onsite and offsite emission. The following simulation shows an example of an upwind Qube device acting as a filter, subtracting detections from the downstream devices. All of this is done on the fly, with upwind and downwind devices being determined based on the wind conditions at that moment.
