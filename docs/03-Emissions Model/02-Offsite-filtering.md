# Offsite Filtering

How can the model differentiate between on site emission sources and other nearby methane producing sources?

A well planned deployment will always include "upwind" devices which can be used to differentiate between onsite and offsite emission. The following simulation shows an example of an upwind Qube device acting as a filter, subtracting detections from the downstream devices. All of this is done on the fly, with upwind and downwind devices being determined based on the wind conditions at that moment.

## The Problem with offsite emissions

The problem with offsite emissions and more detail on how they are identified is outlined in the following article:

## Case Study

A case study of an operator in a densely spaced oilfield using the Qube platform to verify leaks in real time can be found here:
